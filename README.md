# 🌐 WebDevelopment-2025 🚀✨  

Hey, I’m **Nayan** — a React dev stocking a vault of web wisdom.  
This repo is a **stash** of roadmaps, theory notes, PDF books, and interview prep — the brain fuel behind the builds.

## 🧭 What’s Inside  

### 📚 Learning & Reference  
- 📖 PDF books, summaries, and highlight notes  
- 🗺️ Topic roadmaps (beginner → pro → “what’s next?”)  
- ❓ Interview question banks + answer outlines  

### ⚛️ Core Stack (Concepts, not code)  
- 🔑 React & JavaScript fundamentals, patterns, and gotchas  
- 🛡️ TypeScript theory: types as design, safety vs. velocity  
- 🎨 CSS thinking: layout systems, tokens, and design semantics  

### 🧩 Frameworks & Libraries (Ecosystem Map)  
- 🧰 UI kits & design systems: **MUI**, **Tailwind**, etc.  
- ⚡ Build & tooling vibes: Vite / Next / Turborepo (conceptual overviews)  
- 🔄 State/data strategies, routing models, DX trade-offs  

### 🤖 Trends, Workflow & Practice  
- 🤝 **LLMs in dev**: prompts, code review, scaffolding, guardrails  
- 🌱 **GitHub**: branches, PR ritual, and review checklists  

---

## 🚀 Why This Exists  

- 📚 To corral **theory** so it doesn’t vanish into tab hell  
- 🧭 To keep **roadmaps** visible when motivation dips  
- 🔎 To park **PDFs & notes** where they’re searchable  
- 🎯 To rehearse with **interview questions** that actually bite  
- 🌐 To sketch the **shape of 2025 web** without getting stuck in boilerplate

## 🧪 Notes  

- 📝 Includes **Love Babbar theory part** and his class mini projects as part of the learning
