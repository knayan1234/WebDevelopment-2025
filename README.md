# 🌐 WebDevelopment-2025 🚀✨

Hey, I’m **Nayan** — a React dev stocking a vault of web wisdom.  
This repo is a **stash** of roadmaps, theory notes, PDF books, and interview prep — the brain fuel behind the builds.

## 🧭 WHAT’S INSIDE

### 📚 Learning & Reference

- PDF books, summaries, and highlight notes
- Topic roadmaps (beginner → pro → “what’s next?”)
- Interview question banks + answer outlines

### ⚛️ Core Stack (Concepts, not code)

- React & JavaScript fundamentals, patterns, and gotchas
- TypeScript theory: types as design, safety vs. velocity
- CSS thinking: layout systems, tokens, and design semantics

### 🧩 Frameworks & Libraries (Ecosystem Map)

- UI kits & design systems: **MUI**, **Tailwind**, etc.
- Build & tooling vibes: Vite/Next/Turborepo (conceptual overviews)
- State/data strategies, routing models, DX trade-offs

### 🤖 Trends, Workflow & Practice

- **LLMs in dev**: prompts, code review, scaffolding, guardrails
- **GitHub**: branches, PR ritual and review checklists

---

## 🚀 WHY THIS EXISTS

- To corral **theory** so it doesn’t vanish into tab hell
- To keep **roadmaps** visible when motivation dips
- To park **PDFs & notes** where they’re searchable
- To rehearse with **interview questions** that actually bite
- To sketch the **shape of 2025 web** without getting stuck in boilerplate

## 🧪 NOTES

- An add-on **Love Babbar theory part** and his class mini projects are also included as part of the learning.
- This is a **thinking space** — concepts first, code elsewhere [LINK TO BE UPLOADED](#).
