## Modules and Import/Export

Modules are launched in ES6 2015 as way to break the code in small files and then export it so the other file can import it and use it.

There are two types of export - one is default and one is named. For default when imported just name of the function is needed while in named, it needs curly braces.

## Scope Privacy

In modules, variables and functions are private by default – they stay inside the module unless you explicitly export them. This prevents accidental access or conflicts, promoting "encapsulation" (hiding internals).

## Top level await

Top-level await lets you use await outside async functions, right at the module's top level. It's part of ES2022 and useful for waiting on promises (like API calls) before the module fully loads

```js
// data.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
export const data = await response.json();
```

This pauses module loading until the fetch completes. It's great for initializing with async data

## How Top-Level Await Affects Module Loading

Top-level await makes module loading asynchronous and blocking for dependents. If module First uses top-level await, any module importing First waits until First's promise resolves. If it rejects, the whole chain fails (use try-catch for errors).

Effect: Modules load like promises; dependents pause until settled. This can slow startup but ensures data is ready.

vs. Regular Await: Regular await needs an async function; top-level doesn't, simplifying code.

Caveats: Only in modules, not scripts. Can cause delays if overused.

## Live bindings

In ES Modules, imports are "live bindings" – they reference the original exported value, updating if it changes. This is like a pointer, not a copy.

## Circular Dependencies

These happen when modules depend on each other in a loop (A imports B, B imports A). ES Modules handle this with partial evaluation: they load in order, using init-like functions to avoid errors.

## How Module Caching Works

Modules are cached after first load – subsequent imports reuse the cached version, speeding things up by avoiding reloads.

## Static Analysis

Static analysis is like having a smart inspector review your code without actually executing it. Tools (such as bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel) scan your JavaScript files at build time to understand the structure, dependencies, and flow of your code.

**How It Works in Practice:**

1. Parsing the Code: The tool reads your files and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) – a tree-like map of your code's structure.
2. Dependency Graph: It creates a graph showing how modules connect via imports/exports.
3. Usage Tracking: It checks which exported items are actually imported and used elsewhere.
4. Flagging Issues: It can spot potential errors, like unused variables or dead code paths.

## Tree Shaking

## Module caching

is a behind-the-scenes optimization in JavaScript runtimes (like Node.js or browsers) that stores loaded modules in memory so they don't need to be reloaded or re-executed multiple times. This speeds up your application by reusing already-processed code. Let's dive deep into how it functions, with examples for both CommonJS and ES Modules, as they handle caching slightly differently.

## CommonJS vs ES Module

| Feature              | CommonJS                            | ES Modules                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax               | `require` and `module.exports`      | `import` and `export`                        |
| Loading Type         | Synchronous                         | Asynchronous                                 |
| Exports Style        | Single object, dynamic              | Named/default, static                        |
| Caching Mechanism    | Shared object instance              | Live bindings/references                     |
| Tree-Shaking Support | Limited or none                     | Full support                                 |
| Top-Level Await      | Not supported                       | Supported                                    |
| Dynamic Imports      | Via `require` anywhere              | Via `import()` function                      |
| Best Environment     | Node.js servers                     | Browsers and modern Node.js                  |
| Potential Drawbacks  | Blocking, no native browser support | Stricter syntax, requires .mjs in some cases |
