right now types of response I added manually but how can i infer types from BE responses 

there are different ways to acheive this

1. **If backend provides OpenAPI/Swagger**

if swagger is available then can generate types automatically using

```jsx
npx openapi-typescript http://localhost:3000/swagger.json --output types/api.d.ts
```

1. **Infer from Axios response directly**

Axios returns a generic `AxiosResponse<T>`. You can extract the type with `typeof` and `Awaited`.

```jsx
const loginRes = await axios.post<LoginToken>("http://localhost:3000/api/login");

// Infer type automatically from the actual axios call
type LoginResponse = Awaited<typeof loginRes>;
// Equivalent to AxiosResponse<LoginToken>

...
type ProductsResponse = typeof res.data;
// Inferred as Products (Product[])

```

here awaited is used in first because we need to wait till Promise is resolved and then need to get the type

in 2nd promise is already resolved we just want its type

1. **Use `as const` with mock data (for local inference)**

```jsx
const mockProduct = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 2000,
} as const;

type Product = typeof mockProduct;

```

if have mock value using as const we can add
