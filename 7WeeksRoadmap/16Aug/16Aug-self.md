### PGSQL and Prisma ORM

PostgreSQL (or "Postgres" for short) is a powerful, free database system where you store and manage data for your apps. It's like the "storage room" behind your React frontend.
t's a relational database: Data is organized into tables (like spreadsheets). Each table has rows (records) and columns (fields). For example, a "users" table might have columns like "id", "name", and "email".

Prisma is a tool (specifically an ORMâ€”Object-Relational Mapper) that makes working with databases like PostgreSQL feel like writing regular JavaScript code. No need to memorize tons of SQL!
Prisma generates a "client" library with auto-completed methods. You use it in your backend code (e.g., Node.js or Next.js API routes) to fetch data, which your React frontend can then display via API calls.
