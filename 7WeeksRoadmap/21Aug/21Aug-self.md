### GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

The "CI/CD" part stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (sometimes "Delivery" instead of Deployment). Here's what that means in basic terms:

Continuous Integration (CI): This is about merging small code changes often and automatically checking if they work. For example, every time you or a teammate adds code, the robot runs tests to catch bugs early. It prevents big problems from piling up.

Continuous Deployment (CD): This takes it further by automatically "deploying" (putting online) your app after the tests pass. So, your updates go live quickly and safely.
