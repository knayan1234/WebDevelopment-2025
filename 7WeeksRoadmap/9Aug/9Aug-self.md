| Tool                       | Definition                                                                                                       | Step-by-Step Process                                                                                                                                               | React Tips                                                                                       |

| Prettier                   | An opinionated code formatter that automatically rewrites code for consistent style (e.g., indentation, quotes). | 1. Install and configure via `.prettierrc.json`.2. Run manually: `prettier --write `.3. It scans and fixes style issues instantly.                                 | Great for uniform JSX prop alignment; reduces manual styling in components.                      |
| ESLint                     | A linting tool that analyzes code for errors, enforces standards, and catches bugs.                              | 1. Configure rules in `.eslintrc.json` (e.g., extend React plugins).2. Run: `eslint  --fix` to scan and auto-fix.3. Flags issues like unhandled promises.          | Use with TypeScript plugins to lint hooks and components; integrate Prettier to avoid conflicts. |
| Husky                      | A tool for Git hooks that runs scripts automatically (e.g., before commits).                                     | 1. Install and initialize: `npx husky install`.2. Add hook: `npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "command"`.3. Activates on Git actions, running scripts if they pass. | Prevents committing broken components; pair with lint-staged for efficiency.                     |
| Lint-Staged (Bonus Helper) | Runs commands only on staged files for efficient workflows.                                                      | 1. Configure in `package.json` for file patterns.2. Triggered by Husky on commit.3. Sequences Prettier then ESLint on changes.                                     | Automates checks in React pipelines; catches issues before they hit the repo.                    |
| Full Integrated Workflow   | Combines all tools for automated quality checks.                                                                 | 1. Edit and stage a file.2. Commit triggers Husky and lint-staged.3. Prettier formats, ESLint lints/fixes; commit succeeds if clean.                               | Enable VS Code auto-save for real-time fixes in React apps; test small to practice.              |

> Linting (via ESLint): This is about analyzing and improving your code quality. ESLint scans your React files for errors, style issues, or best practices (e.g., "Hey, you forgot a key in this list!").

Husky: This is about automation through Git hooks. It doesn't check code itselfâ€” it just sets up scripts to run tools (like ESLint) automatically at specific times, like before you commit.
