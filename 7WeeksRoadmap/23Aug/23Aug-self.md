### Monitoring

What is Monitoring?
Monitoring is like watching over your React app to spot problems early. It helps you track how well your app works, find errors (mistakes that cause crashes or bugs), and understand what users experience.

Why do it? React apps can slow down, crash, or confuse users. Monitoring collects data (like speed, errors, and user actions) so you can fix issues quickly.

Key parts of monitoring:

Performance monitoring: Checks how fast your app loads and runs (e.g., how long a button takes to respond).

Error tracking: Catches mistakes like code errors or failed connections.

User experience metrics: Tracks what users do, like clicks or page visits.

Real-time optimization: Finds and fixes slow parts while the app is running

> Two tools are ther for monitoring

### What is Sentry?

Sentry is a tool that helps monitor errors and performance in your React app. It automatically reports problems like crashes and slow spots, giving you details to fix them.

It's like a security camera for your codeâ€”it watches for issues and sends alerts.

Sentry is free to start and works well with React by adding special code to track things.

### What is LogRocket?

LogRocket is another monitoring tool that records videos of user sessions (what users do in your app). It helps you see bugs as they happen, like a replay of the problem.

It tracks errors, user actions, and even filters sessions by app updates.

Difference from Sentry: LogRocket focuses more on video replays of user interactions, while Sentry is great for detailed error reports.
