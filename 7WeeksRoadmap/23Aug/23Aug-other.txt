Frontend Monitoring tools logs JS errors, Api request/response errors , user behavior monitoring , this monitoring helps to

- Improve **UX** by quickly detecting crashes or slowdowns.
- Provide **real-world data** on how apps perform in user devices.
- Help prioritize fixes that affect the most users.

‚ö° What is **Sentry**?

**Sentry** is a popular **error tracking and performance monitoring tool**.

It helps you:

- Capture **JavaScript/frontend crashes**.
- Track **backend errors**.
- Monitor **performance issues** (slow API calls, page load).
- See **stack traces + user sessions** to reproduce bugs.

üëâ In short: Sentry = a **‚Äúblack box recorder‚Äù for your app‚Äôs errors**.

to integrate sentry , first need to install using npm and integrate it to index.js 

the issues/ alerts can be seen in dashboard

install

npm install @sentry/react @sentry/tracing

index.js

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
dsn: "https://YOUR_PROJECT_KEY.ingest.sentry.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID", // from Sentry dashboard
integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

// Capture performance issues
tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust in production (e.g., 0.2 for 20%)
});

wrapping app

<Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong</p>}>
<App />
</Sentry.ErrorBoundary>

adding breadcrumps log and leading to error manuallly

What are **Breadcrumbs**?

Breadcrumbs = **logs of events leading up to an error**.

Example: clicks, route changes, API calls, console logs.

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

// Add breadcrumb manually
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
category: "auth",
message: "User clicked login button",
level: "info",  // can be info, warning, error
});

Eg:

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

function checkout() {
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({ category: "cart", message: "User clicked checkout", level: "info" });

try {
// Some failing code
throw new Error("Payment gateway timeout");
} catch (err) {
Sentry.captureException(err);
}
}

üëâ In Sentry dashboard you‚Äôll see:

1. Breadcrumb ‚Üí `User clicked checkout`
2. Error ‚Üí `Payment gateway timeout`

client-only crashes that QA can‚Äôt reproduce are exactly why monitoring tools like **Sentry** (or similar) exist.

- Use `Sentry.captureException(err)` for manual logging.

üëâ This ensures that **even if QA can‚Äôt reproduce**, the error is captured **on the user‚Äôs browser** and sent to your dashboard.

. Use **Breadcrumbs**

Sentry automatically records **breadcrumbs** (console logs, clicks, route changes, API calls).

You can also add **custom breadcrumbs**

This shows the sequence of events that led to the crash.

‚úÖ Debugging Workflow for a Client-Only Crash

**Deploy app with monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)**

**User hits crash ‚Üí Error + breadcrumbs + environment sent to dashboard**

**Developer inspects stack trace + user steps** (QA doesn‚Äôt need to reproduce manually)

Optionally, **session replay** shows exact behavior ‚Üí pinpoint issue.

In short: If QA can‚Äôt reproduce, **instrument your frontend** so that **errors debug themselves** : stack trace + breadcrumbs + environment + replay = root cause.
