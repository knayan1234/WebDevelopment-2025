in FE folder structure is important because of 
-Maintainability - A clear structure makes it easy to find, update, or delete files without confusion.
-Scalability - As the app grows, structure prevents chaos. Teams can work independently on features.
-Team Productivity - New devs onboard faster when structure is predictable and consistent.


Feature based design also similar to atomic
in atomic there atom , modules etc will be there but in feature based Organizes code by feature/domain 
instead of atom and molecules folders here features , hooks, shared, context etc folders will be there 


in big projects instead of importing file from '../../../../context/provider/...." 
instead of doing a long path we can do aliases

import CartProvider from '@/context/CartProvider';

for this we need to update in config file
tsconfig.json(TypeScript) , jsconfig.json(JavaScript)


{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",  // early every location was starting from root since base given as src from now on filepath will start from src not root
    "paths": {
      "@features/*": ["features/*"],
      "@shared/*": ["shared/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["hooks/*"],
      "@contexts/*": ["contexts/*"],
      "@lib/*": ["lib/*"]
    }
  }
}


can import files like this
import Button from '@shared/components/Button';
 Project:

├── jsconfig.json          baseUrl = "src"
├── package.json
├── public/
└── src/                   from here location starts while importing
    ├── App.jsx
    ├── pages/
    │   └── HomePage.jsx  ← you are here
    ├── shared/
    │   └── components/
    │       └── Button.jsx
    ├── hooks/
    │   └── useAuth.js           ← Custom React hooks
    │
    ├── contexts/
    │   └── AuthContext.jsx      ← React Context for global state
    │
    ├── lib/
    │   └── api.js               ← Axios/fetch setup


Atomic design is good for
 work closely with design systems or Storybook
 good for static sites, portfolios, marketing pages
 Your app is not feature-heavy, but UI-complex

Feature Based
  These have many features, logic, API interactions, and states
  You need to isolate tests, state, API, UI per feature
  Team autonomy and fewer merge conflicts



at situation we can make a hybrid approach as well. hybrid means combination of both
