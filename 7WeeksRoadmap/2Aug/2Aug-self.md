/features: This is the core of your new structure. Each sub-directory inside /features represents a distinct feature of your application (e.g., /authentication, /product-list, /checkout). A feature folder should contain everything related to that feature: components, hooks, API calls, and state.

/shared: This directory holds code that can be reused across multiple features. It should not contain any business logic specific to a feature. It's often broken down further:

/shared/ui: Reusable, "dumb" UI components like Button, Input, Modal.

/shared/hooks: Reusable hooks like useLocalStorage or useDebounce.

/shared/config: Application-wide configuration.

/lib: This is the place for third-party library integrations or utility functions that are not specific to React. For example, an axios instance configuration, date formatting utilities (date-fns), or other helper functions would go here.

/hooks: This folder is reserved for global custom hooks that are central to the application's operation, such as a useAuth hook that might be used on almost every page. Hooks that are specific to a feature should live inside that feature's folder.

/contexts: A dedicated home for your app-wide React Context providers and consumers, like ThemeContext or AuthContext.

## setting up alias for project

we need to create jsconfig and tsconfig and add this

{
"compilerOptions": {
"baseUrl": "src",
"paths": {
"@/_": ["_"]
}
},
"include": ["src"]
}

"baseUrl": "src": Tells the compiler that the base directory for module resolution is /src.

"paths": { "@/_": ["_"] }: Creates the alias. Now, any import starting with @/ will be resolved relative to the baseUrl. For example, @/features/authentication will point directly to src/features/authentication.

**for vite**
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
plugins: [react()],
resolve: {
alias: {
'@': path.resolve(\_\_dirname, './src'),
},
},
});
