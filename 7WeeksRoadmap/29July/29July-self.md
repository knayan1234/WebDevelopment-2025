# Context API

The React Context API provides a way to share data across a component tree without having to pass props down manually through every level.T he primary problem that the Context API solves is prop drilling.
Three main steps:

1. creating the context
2. providing it to the components that need it
3. and then consuming it within those components.

# when not to use

- Performance problems with frequent updates.

- When props are simpler.

- When a state management library is a better fit.
