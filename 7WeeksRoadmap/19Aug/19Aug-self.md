### Unit testing

Unit testing is a software testing method where you test the smallest isolatable parts of your code—called "units"—in complete isolation from the rest of the application. In React, a unit is typically a single component, function, or hook. The goal is to ensure each unit behaves exactly as expected under various conditions, like different inputs (props), states, or user interactions.
